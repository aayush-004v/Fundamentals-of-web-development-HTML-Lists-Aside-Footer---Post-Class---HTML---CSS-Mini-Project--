## Detailed Description: 
Simple Price Grid component 

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

To make an HTML element behave as a grid container, you have to set the display property to grid or inline-grid.

Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows.

## Why this project was chosen:
div and container is used to divide the blocks in different section. It help me to build the different 
block and easy to use CSS.

## My process:
1. In the html file at first a bunch of cards is written one after another. Then in the stylesheet the background and the card layout structures are set using background and color padding and margin properties. 

2. Font family and card colors used as per the specification mentioned above in the Style specification.

3. Respective card background are applied as in hsl color scheme format. 

4. For span of the cards  grid-template-columns and grid row properties has been used.

5. For responsiveness media query is used.

## Scope of development:
    more testimonials can be added and along with other testimonials it can be rearranged.
